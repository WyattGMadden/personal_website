I am currently pursuing PhD in Biostatistics at Emory University. Previously I worked as a statistician for Bozeman Disease Ecology Lab where we studied viral spillover from bats to susceptible populations. My research interests involve Bayesian statistics with a focus on spatio-temporal data, machine learning, and data integration methods for viral surveillance. I also have experience providing general data science support through data visualization, SQL database design and management, and the building of web based applications.
