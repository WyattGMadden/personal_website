I am currently pursuing PhD in Biostatistics at Emory University with research focused on statistical machine learning methods for spatio-temporal data.
Previously I have contributed statistics and machine learning expertise to a wide array of problems, including disease ecology, high-energy-density physics, air polution monitoring, epidemic spread of disease, and industrial process optimization.
I also have experience providing general data science support through data visualization, SQL database design and management, and the building of web applications.
