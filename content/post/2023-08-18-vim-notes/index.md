This is list of vim tricks I want to remember and start using regularly. 

## [Make same change to many lines](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9549729/vim-insert-the-same-characters-across-multiple-lines)

1. Enter visual block mode <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd>

2. Move down all lines to change (ie. highlighting one letter per line)

3. Press <kbd> I </kbd>

4. Make changes 

5. Press <kbd> Esc </kbd>
